The Rajasthan government on Sunday announced a 15-day lockdown in the state till May 3. Following the announcement, fear of job loss and uncertainty about livelihood drove migrant workers in the state to get back to their hometowns in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

Even though the lockdown order allowed industries and factories to function in order to prevent migration of labour, the recollection of the 2020 lockdown was enough for the migrant workers to start heading home.
